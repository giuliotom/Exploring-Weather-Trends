Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project I

# Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

What Software Do I need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

1) SQL
2) Excel or Google Sheeyts


# Extracting Data

To start I wrote an SQL query to retrieve all the temperature data from:

Local Database (Milan)
Global Database


# Data Selection & Manipulation

To analyze the temperature trend, i wrote an SQL query to visualize in the same table the average global temperature and Milan average temperature and hen downloaded the respective csv file.
In this way there are only the years in which both Milan and the rest of the world have data.
Data set is ranged 1750-2013


Moreover, due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (10-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization.
